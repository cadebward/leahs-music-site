          About Leah
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Soprano Leah Ward has been singing since before she could talk. As a
          young child she was involved in the International Children’s Choir
          based out of Salt Lake City. With them, she sang multiple times a week
          for local and international dignitaries. Leah was very involved in
          music through her Junior High and High School years. She played the
          cello in her school orchestras and was heavily involved in the Woods
          Cross High School Madrigal choir and Concert choir. She went on to
          earn a degree in Vocal Performance at Utah State University. Leah was
          part of both the USU Chamber Singers as well as the USU Opera program.
          Being part of these groups gave her several opportunities for solo
          performances. After graduating Leah had the opportunity to sing under
          the direction of Dr. Craig Jessop in the American Festival Chorus
          based in Logan, Utah. She has sung around the world on stages in the
          United States, Canada, Mexico, and China.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Leah specializes in musical genres such as classical, opera, musical
          theatre, and choral music. She is also proficient in music theory. She
          has 10 years of private vocal training and has been teaching private
          voice lessons for 6 years.

          My Goal as Your Teacher
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          My goal as a voice teacher is to help my students learn about their
          natural voice, gain better breath support, increase their vocal range,
          and become more comfortable with performances and auditions. My
          students are able to try several different genres and I encourage
          creativity.

            personality and works well with my daughter. She has helped her
            increase her vocal range and introduced songs that have challenged her
            and helped her voice develop. As a teacher Leah is dependable and
            flexible. She lets her vocal families know her expectations up front
            and has been a pleasure to work with. My daughter genuinely looks
            forward to her voice lessons every week.</p>

            teacher. She helped me grow so much as a singer and a performer.
            She is great at coming up with different exercises and different
