          About Leah
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Leah Ward has been singing since before she could talk. As a child, she was involved in Children’s Choirs that
          provided many performance opportunities from a young age. Growing up, she was very involved in private lessons
          and ensembles involving the piano, cello, and of course, singing. A defining time in her young musical career
          was her two year involvement with her High School Madrigals. It was at this time that Leah realized she wanted
          music, and more specifically singing, to be a huge part of her life. She went on to earn a degree in Vocal
          Performance at Utah State University. Leah was part of both the USU Chamber Singers as well as the USU Opera
          program. Being part of these groups gave her opportunities for solo performances. After graduating Leah had
          the opportunity to sing under the direction of Dr. Craig Jessop in the American Festival Chorus based in
          Logan, Utah. She has sung around the world on stages in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and China. Leah is
          currently a member of the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square which has deepened her understanding and love of
          the vocal instrument.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Leah specializes in musical genres such as classical, opera, musical theatre, and choral music. She is also
          proficient in music theory and has taught private voice lessons for 10+ years.

          My Goal as Your Teacher
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          My goal as a voice teacher is to help my students learn about their
          natural voice, gain better breath support, increase their vocal range,
          and become more comfortable with performances and auditions. My
          students are able to try several different genres and I encourage
          creativity.

            personality and works well with my daughter. She has helped her
            increase her vocal range and introduced songs that have challenged her
            and helped her voice develop. As a teacher Leah is dependable and
            flexible. She lets her vocal families know her expectations up front
            and has been a pleasure to work with. My daughter genuinely looks
            forward to her voice lessons every week.</p>
